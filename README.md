Gift a Meal is your one-stop service to pick up or donate free meals from your home or restaurant in a sustainable way! With the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges that come with it, many people are struggling to provide for their families and themselves. Why not help out by offering the excess food from your restaurant/organization to someone in need! 

#How it works
Donors would be an organization, restaurant or an individual.  Donors would be able to register and provide required information. After this whenever there is a surplus of food, donors can quickly update the amount of food available for pickup. 
 
Recipients could be individuals in quarantine due to Covid-19 and have financial problems or students who are planning to save up during these times. Recipients can register and provide required information. After this, every time a donor has meals available for pickup it will immediately send an alert to your phone!
